# Music Light Box

Erik Macik

Music Light Box is a program that demonstrates the use of the MSP430's
buttons, LEDs, and speaker.

## How it works:
* Button S1 will cycle the red led through on, off, and dim.
* Button S2 will cycle the green led through on, off, and dim.
* Button S3 will play the theme song from the Disney Pixar film "Up."
* Button S4 will play "Mia & Sebastian's Theme" from the film "La La Land."

## How to run the project on an MSP430:
1. Download the "project" repository.
2. From this directory, run the make file to install TimerLib. This command will also run the outfile in the music_light_box directory.
3. Go to the music_light_box directory.
4. Make sure your MSP430 is plugged into your computer and connected to the Virtual Machine.
5. Run the command "make load."
